        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>When I was very young, one day my mom came to me with some paper and she folded piece a flapping bird and then she folded another piece into a jumping frog. Then she gave me an origami book and she told me that I could make any toys I wanted out of paper; her words blew my mind. I've been folding paper doing origami ever since and I love it.</p>
        <p>I think coding can be a lot like origami in a lot of ways and that's why I like it too. Take a look at my projects for this semester.</p>
